## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open an issue directly on GitHub.** This helps to avoid public exposure of the vulnerability.
2. **Contact me directly on GitHub**:

    - Click on the "Message" button to send me a direct message with the following details:
        - Description of the vulnerability.
        - Steps to reproduce the issue.
        - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
        - Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

We will respond to your report within 5 business days to confirm receipt and provide an estimated timeline for
resolution. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will coordinate with you to disclose the issue responsibly.

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with the community to identify and address security issues in a timely manner. To that end,
we encourage responsible disclosure practices. If you follow the steps outlined above, we will:

- Acknowledge your report promptly.
